# Sortable Lists in Rails 5

As the [RailsCast #147 on Sortable Lists](http://railscasts.com/episodes/147-sortable-lists)
is somewhat outdated, I've created an own short demo on how to implement dynamically
sortable lists in an Rails Application.
It can be found here: [https://github.com/drblinken/sortable-list-demo]( https://github.com/drblinken/sortable-list-demo) - the
[README](https://github.com/drblinken/sortable-list-demo/blob/master/README.md) contains a list of the steps I've taken.

The main part can be found in [https://github.com/drblinken/sortable-list-demo/blob/master/app/views/lists/show.html.erb](https://github.com/drblinken/sortable-list-demo/blob/master/app/views/lists/show.html.erb),
and all other steps can be seen in the [commits](https://github.com/drblinken/sortable-list-demo/commits/master).
