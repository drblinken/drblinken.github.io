Hello World from Dr. Blinken
===========

I finally found a place to put up all my notes on Rails and other technical stuff on the net: [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). They are wonderful - I can write markup, push it to the repository and tada - the site is up. All with git version control and collaboration support using [Markdown]({{ site.baseurl }}bentos/markdown.html) and [Jekyll]({{ site.baseurl }}bentos/jekyll.html).


The site will be filled with notes for my rails classes as well as bentosheets ("cheat sheets") for other technical things that I figure out and forget about until the next time I need them. _Students, please fork this project and send me pull requests if you feel something needs to be added._

I put up some [fotos on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.116295228517131.32073.100004099643213&type=1) that might give you an idea where that nick name came from.
