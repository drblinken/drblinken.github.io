title: Come Teach Web Technology!
---

Dear Eurucampers,

I love the ruby community for it's great open diverse learning culture, among it events like Eurucamp, User Groups, last not least Rails Girls - [but there's also a more formal course of education out there](http://imi-master.htw-berlin.de), and I've heard a couple of not-so-nice-stories about experiences with that (luckily, in general, not ours ;-) ) this weekend, so, if you'd like to help me improve that, here are some opportunities:

* I'm always looking for Bachelor- and Master Thesis topics. I'm interested in everything that has to do with Web Technology and Software Engineering. I value theses that are done in cooperation with a company or real-live-interest - there are consistently deeper and more interesting than theses that are only grounded on student's and my ideas.

* Practical Project: Our Students have to do a semester-long project, that is 4-6 students working on a project - [here are some examples of the last terms](http://imi-bachelor.htw-berlin.de/studieren/projekte/showtime-im-sommersemester-2014/) - contact me if you have an idea what could be accomplished as a project.

* Instructor for Web Technology in our Master's Programme: currently we're missing an Instructor "Lehrbeauftragter" for our class Web Technology.

If you're interested in any of this, come speak to me during Eurucamp - I'll be around till the roundup this afternoon, and some of the organizers know me (like PragTob with his wonderful green T-Shirt or Dajana) and might
be able to point me out to you.

And, everything can be done in English, in fact we would love to have more english speaking instructors.

Cheers
