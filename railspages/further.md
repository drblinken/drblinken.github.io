# Pointers for further Reading

## Rails Documentation
* The [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) are an excellent starting point.
* with [Active Record Querying Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html) you'll be able to perform all kind of searches on your model, and
* you'll find all available data types for fields in [ActiveRecord Migrations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html)
* Tobi of RailsGirls Berlin created a [Cheat Sheet for Rails Beginners](http://pragtob.github.io/rails-beginner-cheatsheet/)
* last not least, [Rails Girls Berlin](http://railsgirlsberlin.de) has pointers to excellent further information.

## Troubleshooting and Everything Else
* first, find and read your error message and find the exact spot/line where the error was caused.
* the latter cannot be stated often enough.
* [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) is a great resource for all issues around rails, not only for troubleshooting, but also for learning how to do things.
* google - e.g. the error message minus any application specific stuff (without "Einsetzstellen")
