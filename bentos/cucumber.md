Cucumber
========
Cucumber is an acceptance test frameworks that allows you to describe features in a language called [Gherkin](https://rubygems.org/gems/gherkin) which reads almost like English.

About Writing Good Feature Descriptions
---------------------------------------

In the berkeley saas-course, web_steps.rb and its support scripts are heavily used, which have been generated by the gem [cucumber-rails-training-wheels](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails-training-wheels/). 

In the comments, they warn about using these files and link to the following blog posts about writing good scenarios. I would say the bottom line is to do it more declarative rather than imperative - rather write "When I Add a new Movie" rather than "When I click on the add button" which implies declaring the steps tailored to the specific scenario rather than reusing generic steps as in web_steps.rb which makes the acceptance tests brittle.

 * [Whose Domain is it anyway](http://dannorth.net/2011/01/31/whose-domain-is-it-anyway/) mainly using wordings from different domains
 * [You're Cuking It Wrong](http://elabs.se/blog/15-you-re-cuking-it-wrong) contains some nice examples how to clean up step descriptions.s

Turnip
------

Turnip is an alternative to cucumber that also runs acceptance tests written in Gherkin - it allows you to include them in the spec dir and run them with rspec which also speeds up running all tests.
